title: "SV-COMP benchmark description schema"
description: |
  This schema (written in YAML) describes a structued data format to be checked
  by [json-schema](http://json-schema.org/). This data format (typically
  written in YAML for convenience) describes enough information about a
  benchmark for it to be both compiled and given to a verifier tool.
# FIXME: What's the right way to do versioning of this schema?
